Context menu - duplicate element (entire element), remove element

Change "Add Child Element" button to only show once doc has been initialised.

Add reg exp validation to user input.

Remember to name page "xmlmill" as in http://www.goblincoding.com/xmlmill

Careful of saving XML at 5 min intervals, might save things the user doesn't want to save...rather save to tmp file and at exit query the user to save.
