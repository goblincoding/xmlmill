Highlight broken XML in red/line numbers.
App breaks when directly editing xml and breaking it in the process before trying to save the changes.
Don't make "Import XML" message optional.  Always show.
Dumb down use - don't choose where to put db's.
Shorten messages and prompts (ppl don't read).
Especially need to pay attention to initial start-up.  Make them fly through using it.
