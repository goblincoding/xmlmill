TROUBLESHOOTING THE APPLICATION ON UBUNTU
=========================================
If you encounter the following error after having downloaded and extracted the tar ball from SourceForge (remember to start the application with the "runXMLMill.sh" script):

"This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin “xcb”.Available platform plugins are: xcb.Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
Aborted (core dumped)"

Navigate to the "platforms" directory and execute the "fixdep.sh" script.  This script will install the missing dependencies on your behalf (ensure that you have root access when running this script).

For any other issues, feel free to contact me:
