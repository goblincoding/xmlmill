TROUBLESHOOTING
================
If you encounter the following error:

"This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin “xcb”.Available platform plugins are: xcb.Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
Aborted (core dumped)"

Navigate to the "platforms" directory and execute the "fixdep.sh" script.  This script will install the missing dependencies on your behalf (ensure that you have root access when running this script).
