This is the first (pretty stable) Alpha release, so please log bugs and errors either via the official tickets link:

https://sourceforge.net/p/xmlmill/tickets/

or alternatively, inform me of problems via this contact form:

For LINUX USERS: this is my first attempt at Linux application deployment and I built the Linux version on Ubuntu 12.04.  If you try it and it bombs, please let me know via the contact form (please also include your distro details).

Any feedback is welcome (and will definitely be appreciated).
