Note: Due to the complications involved in distributing binaries to *nix platforms, I am yet to figure out a reliable way to distribute the *nix flavours...if you know how to do so for your specific platform, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with a quick how-to or, better yet, a script ;)
